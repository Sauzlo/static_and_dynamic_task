### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    # line below should be == to compare the values of card.value and 1
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
      # line below should contain a colon: after else
    else
      return False
   
  # dif in the line below should be def to declare a method, there should also be a comma between card1 and card2
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  # line below and subsequent lines should be indented
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    # line below card is not a recognised object and would likely be card1
    return card
  else:
    return card2
  

# def below should be indented to contain it in class
def cards_total(self, cards):
  # total in the line below should equal something to declare it as a variable
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
```
